CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING RULES:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code blocks, no explanations before or after
2. Start your response with { and end with }
3. ALL string content must have special characters escaped:
   - Newlines: use \\n (two characters: backslash + n)
   - Tabs: use \\t
   - Quotes inside strings: use \\"
   - Backslashes: use \\\\ (two characters: backslash + backslash)
4. Do NOT use actual line breaks inside JSON string values
5. Each file's content must be a single-line JSON string with escaped newlines

REQUIRED JSON FORMAT:
{"files": [{"path": "filename.ext", "content": "line1\\nline2\\nline3"}], "instructions": "Setup steps here"}

EXAMPLE OF CORRECT OUTPUT:
{"files": [{"path": "index.html", "content": "<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html>\\n<head>\\n  <title>App</title>\\n</head>\\n<body>\\n  <h1>Hello</h1>\\n</body>\\n</html>"}, {"path": "style.css", "content": "body {\\n  margin: 0;\\n  padding: 20px;\\n}"}], "instructions": "Open index.html in a browser"}

FILES TO GENERATE (based on tech stack):
